Satpy's Documentation
=====================

Satpy is a python library for reading, manipulating, and writing data from
remote-sensing earth-observing satellite instruments. Satpy
provides users with readers that convert geophysical parameters from various
file formats to the common Xarray :class:`~xarray.DataArray` and
:class:`~xarray.Dataset` classes for easier interoperability with other
scientific python libraries. Satpy also provides interfaces for creating
RGB (Red/Green/Blue) images and other composite types by combining data
from multiple instrument bands or products. Various atmospheric corrections
and visual enhancements are provided for improving the usefulness and quality
of output images. Output data can be written to
multiple output file formats such as PNG, GeoTIFF, and CF standard NetCDF
files. Satpy also allows users to resample data to geographic projected grids
(areas). Satpy is maintained by the open source
`Pytroll <http://pytroll.github.io/>`_ group.

The Satpy library acts as a high-level abstraction layer on top of other
libraries maintained by the Pytroll group including:

- `pyresample <http://pyresample.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
- `pyspectral <https://pyspectral.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
- `trollimage <http://trollimage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
- `pycoast <https://pycoast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
- `pydecorate <https://pydecorate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
- `python-geotiepoints <https://python-geotiepoints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
- `pyninjotiff <https://github.com/pytroll/pyninjotiff>`_

Go to the Satpy project_ page for source code and downloads.

Satpy is designed to be easily extendable to support any earth observation
satellite by the creation of plugins (readers, compositors, writers, etc).
The table at the bottom of this page shows the input formats supported by
the base Satpy installation.

.. note::

    Satpy's interfaces are not guaranteed stable and may change until version
    1.0 when backwards compatibility will be a main focus.

.. versionchanged:: 0.20.0
