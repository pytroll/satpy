  ndvi_hybrid_green:
    description: >
      The FCI green band at 0.51 µm deliberately misses the chlorophyll band, such that
      the signal comes from aerosols and ash rather than vegetation. An effect
      is that vegetation in a true colour RGB looks rather brown than green and barren rather red. Mixing in
      some part of the NIR 0.8 channel reduced this effect.  Note that the fractions
      currently implemented are experimental and may change in future versions of Satpy.

    # This will set all clear pixels to '0', all pixles with cloudy features (meteorological/dust/ash clouds) to '1' and
    # missing/undefined pixels to 'nan'. This can be used for the the official EUMETSAT cloud mask product (CLM).

  true_color:
    compositor: !!python/name:satpy.composites.SelfSharpenedRGB
    description: >
      FCI true color composite.  The green band is simulated based on a combination of
      channels.  This simulation may change in future versions of Satpy.  See the description
      of the ndvi_hybrid_green composites for details.

    compositor: !!python/name:satpy.composites.SelfSharpenedRGB
