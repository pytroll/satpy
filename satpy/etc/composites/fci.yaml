  indexed_hybrid_green:
    description: >
      The FCI green band at 0.51 µm deliberately misses the chlorophyll band, such that
      the signal comes from aerosols and ash rather than vegetation. An effect
      is that vegetation in a true colour RGB looks rather brown than green and barren rather red. Mixing in
      some part of the NIR 0.8 channel reduced this effect.  Note that the fractions
      currently implemented are experimental and may change in future versions of Satpy.
