"""Parallax correction.

Routines related to parallax correction using datasets involving height, such
as cloud top height.

The geolocation of (geostationary) satellite imagery is calculated by
agencies or in satpy readers with the assumption of a clear view from
the satellite to the geoid.  When a cloud blocks the view of the Earth
surface or the surface is above sea level, the geolocation is not accurate
for the cloud or mountain top.  This module contains routines to correct
imagery such that pixels are shifted or interpolated to correct for this
parallax effect.

Parallax correction is currently only supported for (cloud top) height
that arrives on an :class:`~pyresample.geometry.AreaDefinition`, such
as is standard for geostationary satellites.  Parallax correction with
data described by a :class:`~pyresample.geometry.SwathDefinition`,
such as is common for polar satellites, is not (yet) supported.

See also the :doc:`../modifiers` page in the documentation for an introduction to
parallax correction as a modifier in Satpy.

    Satellite geolocation generally assumes an unobstructed view of a smooth
    Earth surface.  In reality, this view may be obstructed by clouds or
    mountains.

    If the view of a pixel at location (lat, lon) is blocked by a cloud
    at height h, this function calculates the (lat, lon) coordinates
    of the cloud above/in front of the invisible surface.

    For scenes that are only partly cloudy, the user might set the cloud top
    height for clear-sky pixels to NaN.  This function will return a corrected
    lat/lon as NaN as well.  The user can use the original lat/lon for those
    pixels or use the higher level :class:`ParallaxCorrection` class.

    This function assumes a spherical Earth.

    .. note::

        Be careful with units!  This code expects ``sat_alt`` and
        ``height`` to be in meter above the Earth's surface.  You may
        have to convert your input correspondingly.  Cloud Top Height
        is usually reported in meters above the Earth's surface, rarely
        in km.  Satellite altitude may be reported in either m or km, but
        orbital parameters are usually in relation to the Earth's centre.
        The Earth radius from pyresample is reported in km.

class ParallaxCorrection:
    """Parallax correction calculations.

    This class contains higher-level functionality to wrap the parallax
    correction calculations in :func:`get_parallax_corrected_lonlats`.  The class is
    initialised using a base area, which is the area for which a corrected
    geolocation will be calculated.  The resulting object is a callable.
    Calling the object with an array of (cloud top) heights returns a
    :class:`~pyresample.geometry.SwathDefinition` describing the new ,
    corrected geolocation.  The cloud top height should cover at least the
    area for which the corrected geolocation will be calculated.

    Note that the ``ctth`` dataset must contain satellite location
    metadata, such as set in the ``orbital_parameters`` dataset attribute
    that is set by many Satpy readers.  It is essential that the datasets to be
    corrected are coming from the same platform as the provided cloud top
    height.

    A note on the algorithm and the implementation.  Parallax correction
    is inherently an inverse problem.  The reported geolocation in
    satellite data files is the true location plus the parallax error.
    Therefore, this class first calculates the true geolocation (using
    :func:`get_parallax_corrected_lonlats`), which gives a shifted longitude and
    shifted latitude on an irregular grid.  The difference between
    the original and the shifted grid is the parallax error or shift.
    The magnitude of this error can be estimated with
    :func:`get_surface_parallax_displacement`.
    With this difference, we need to invert the parallax correction to
    calculate the corrected geolocation.  Due to parallax correction,
    high clouds shift a lot, low clouds shift a little, and cloud-free
    pixels shift not at all.  The shift may result in zero, one,
    two, or more source pixel onto a destination pixel.  Physically,
    this corresponds to the situation where a narrow but high cloud is
    viewed at a large angle.  The cloud may occupy two or more pixels when
    viewed at a large angle, but only one when viewed straight from above.
    To accurately reproduce this perspective, the parallax correction uses
    the :class:`~pyresample.bucket.BucketResampler` class, specifically
    the :meth:`~pyresample.bucket.BucketResampler.get_abs_max` method, to
    retain only the largest absolute shift (corresponding to the highest
    cloud) within each pixel.  Any other resampling method at this step
    would yield incorrect results.  When cloud moves over clear-sky, the
    clear-sky pixel is unshifted and the shift is located exactly in the
    centre of the grid box, so nearest-neighbour resampling would lead to
    such shifts being deselected.  Other resampling methods would average
    large shifts with small shifts, leading to unpredictable results.
    Now the reprojected shifts can be applied to the original lat/lon,
    returning a new :class:`~pyresample.geometry.SwathDefinition`.
    This is is the object returned by :meth:`corrected_area`.

    This procedure can be configured as a modifier using the
    :class:`ParallaxCorrectionModifier` class.  However, the modifier can only
    be applied to one dataset at the time, which may not provide optimal
    performance, although dask should reuse identical calculations between
    multiple channels.

    performance:

    cth_resampler
        Resampler to use when resampling (cloud top) height to the base area.
        Defaults to "nearest".
    cth_radius_of_influence
        Radius of influence to use when resampling the (cloud top) height to
        the base area.  Defaults to 50000.
    lonlat_chunks
        Chunk size to use when obtaining longitudes and latitudes from the area
        definition.  Defaults to 1024.  If you set this to None, then parallax
        correction will involve premature calculation.  Changing this may or
        may not make parallax correction slower or faster.
    dataset_radius_of_influence
        Radius of influence to use when resampling the dataset onto the
        swathdefinition describing the parallax-corrected area.  Defaults to
        50000.  This always uses nearest neighbour resampling.

    Alternately, you can use the lower-level API directly with the
    :class:`ParallaxCorrection` class, which may be more efficient if multiple
    datasets need to be corrected.  RGB Composites cannot be modified in this way
    (i.e. you can't replace "VIS006" by "natural_color").  To get a parallax
    corrected RGB composite, create a new composite where each input has the
    modifier applied.  The parallax calculation should only occur once, because
    calculations are happening via dask and dask should reuse the calculation.
