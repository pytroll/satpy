    """Group series of files by file pattern information.

    By default this will group files by their filename ``start_time``
    assuming it exists in the pattern. By passing the individual
    dictionaries returned by this function to the Scene classes'
    ``filenames``, a series `Scene` objects can be easily created.

    .. versionadded:: 0.12

    Args:
        files_to_sort (iterable): File paths to sort in to group
        reader (str or Collection[str]): Reader or readers whose file patterns
            should be used to sort files.  If not given, try all readers (slow,
            adding a list of readers is strongly recommended).
        time_threshold (int): Number of seconds used to consider time elements
            in a group as being equal. For example, if the 'start_time' item
            is used to group files then any time within `time_threshold`
            seconds of the first file's 'start_time' will be seen as occurring
            at the same time.
        group_keys (list or tuple): File pattern information to use to group
            files. Keys are sorted in order and only the first key is used when
            comparing datetime elements with `time_threshold` (see above). This
            means it is recommended that datetime values should only come from
            the first key in ``group_keys``. Otherwise, there is a good chance
            that files will not be grouped properly (datetimes being barely
            unequal). Defaults to a reader's ``group_keys`` configuration (set
            in YAML), otherwise ``('start_time',)``.  When passing multiple
            readers, passing group_keys is strongly recommended as the
            behaviour without doing so is undefined.
        reader_kwargs (dict): Additional keyword arguments to pass to reader
            creation.

    Returns:
        List of dictionaries mapping 'reader' to a list of filenames.
        Each of these dictionaries can be passed as ``filenames`` to

    Use `start_time` and/or `end_time` to limit found filenames by the times
    in the filenames (not the internal file metadata). Files are matched if
    they fall anywhere within the range specified by these parameters.

    Searching is **NOT** recursive.

    Files may be either on-disk or on a remote file system.  By default,
    files are searched for locally.  Users can search on remote filesystems by
    passing an instance of an implementation of
    `fsspec.spec.AbstractFileSystem` (strictly speaking, any object of a class
    implementing a ``glob`` method works).

    If locating files on a local file system, the returned dictionary
    can be passed directly to the `Scene` object through the `filenames`
    keyword argument.  If it points to a remote file system, it is the
    responsibility of the user to download the files first (directly
    reading from cloud storage is not currently available in Satpy).

    The behaviour of time-based filtering depends on whether or not the filename
    contains information about the end time of the data or not:

      - if the end time is not present in the filename, the start time of the filename
        is used and has to fall between (inclusive) the requested start and end times
      - otherwise, the timespan of the filename has to overlap the requested timespan

    Example usage for querying a s3 filesystem using the s3fs module:

    >>> import s3fs, satpy.readers, datetime
    >>> satpy.readers.find_files_and_readers(
    ...     base_dir="s3://noaa-goes16/ABI-L1b-RadF/2019/321/14/",
    ...     fs=s3fs.S3FileSystem(anon=True),
    ...     reader="abi_l1b",
    ...     start_time=datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 17, 14, 40))
    {'abi_l1b': [...]}

    Args:
        start_time (datetime): Limit used files by starting time.
        end_time (datetime): Limit used files by ending time.
        base_dir (str): The directory to search for files containing the
                        data to load. Defaults to the current directory.
        reader (str or list): The name of the reader to use for loading the data or a list of names.
        sensor (str or list): Limit used files by provided sensors.
        filter_parameters (dict): Filename pattern metadata to filter on. `start_time` and `end_time` are
                                  automatically added to this dictionary. Shortcut for
                                  `reader_kwargs['filter_parameters']`.
        reader_kwargs (dict): Keyword arguments to pass to specific reader
                              instances to further configure file searching.
        missing_ok (bool): If False (default), raise ValueError if no files
                            are found.  If True, return empty dictionary if no
                            files are found.
