            name (str): A name for this writer for log and error messages.
                If this writer is configured in a YAML file its name should
                match the name of the YAML file. Writer names may also appear
                in output file attributes.
            filename (str): Filename to save data to. This filename can and
                should specify certain python string formatting fields to
                differentiate between data written to the files. Any
                attributes provided by the ``.attrs`` of a DataArray object

            base_dir (str):
                Base destination directories for all created files.

                data to be more visually useful and to fit inside the file

            `delayed.compute()` or a tuple of (source, target) that should be
            passed to :func:`dask.array.store`. If target is provided the the
            caller is responsible for calling `target.close()` if the target
            has this method.
