def group_results_by_output_file(sources, targets):
    """Group results by output file.

    For writers that return sources and targets for ``compute=False``, split
    the results by output file.

    When not only the data but also GeoTIFF tags are dask arrays, then
    ``save_datasets(..., compute=False)``` returns a tuple of flat lists,
    where the second list consists of a mixture of ``RIOTag`` and ``RIODataset``
    objects (from trollimage).  In some cases, we may want to get a seperate
    delayed object for each file; for example, if we want to add a wrapper to do
    something with the file as soon as it's finished.  This function unflattens
    the flat lists into a list of (src, target) tuples.

    For example, to close files as soon as computation is completed::

        >>> @dask.delayed
        >>> def closer(obj, targs):
        ...     for targ in targs:
        ...         targ.close()
        ...     return obj
        >>> (srcs, targs) = sc.save_datasets(writer="ninjogeotiff", compute=False, **ninjo_tags)
        >>> for (src, targ) in group_results_by_output_file(srcs, targs):
        ...     delayed_store = da.store(src, targ, compute=False)
        ...     wrapped_store = closer(delayed_store, targ)
        ...     wrapped.append(wrapped_store)
        >>> compute_writer_results(wrapped)

    In the wrapper you can do other useful tasks, such as writing a log message
    or moving files to a different directory.

    .. warning::

        Adding a callback may impact runtime and RAM.  The pattern or cause is
        unclear.  Tests with FCI data show that for resampling with high RAM
        use (from around 15 GB), runtime increases when a callback is added.
        Tests with ABI or low RAM consumption rather show a decrease in runtime.
