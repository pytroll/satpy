Feature: Simple and intuitive scene loading (sc. 1)

    The scientific user explores the data and prototypes new algorithms.
    It needs access not only to the calibrated data,
    but also to the raw data and probably a majority of the metadata.
    The user would work with data locally, and it has to be easy to tell satpy where the data is.
    Providing filename templates or editing config file before starting working is a pain, so it should be avoided.

    To load the data should be a simple 1-step procedure.
    At load time, the user provides the data and metadata he/she needs,
    and if some items are unavailable/unaccessible,
    the user should be informed in a gentle but clear way (ie. no crash).
    The data and metadata available from the file have to be explorable,
    so that the user donâ€™t need to guess what the (meta)data is called.

    Scenario: 1-step data loading
        Given data is available
        When user loads the data without providing a config file
        Then the data is available in a scene object

    @download
    Scenario: No crash when metadata is missing
        Given data is available
        When user loads the data without providing a config file
        And some items are not available
        Then the data is available in a scene object

    @download
    Scenario: Data is explorable
        Given data is available
        When user wants to know what data is available
        Then available datasets is returned

    Scenario: Accessing datasets by name prefers less modified datasets
        Given datasets with the same name
        When a dataset is retrieved by name
        Then the least modified version of the dataset is returned
