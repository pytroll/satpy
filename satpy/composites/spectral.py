class HybridGreen(SpectralBlender):
    """Corrector of the FCI or AHI green band.

    The green band in FCI and AHI (and other bands centered at 0.51 microns) deliberately
    misses the chlorophyll spectral reflectance local maximum at 0.55 microns
    in order to focus on aerosol and ash rather than on vegetation. This
    affects true colour RGBs, because vegetation looks brown rather than green
    and barren surface types typically gets a reddish hue.

    To correct for this the hybrid green approach proposed by Miller et al. (2016, :doi:`10.1175/BAMS-D-15-00154.2`)
    is used. The basic idea is to include some contribution also from the 0.86 micron
    channel, which is known for its sensitivity to vegetation. The formula used for this is::

      hybrid_green = (1 - F) * R(0.51) + F * R(0.86)

    where F is a constant value, that is set to 0.15 by default in Satpy.

    For example, the HybridGreen compositor can be used as follows to construct a hybrid green channel for
    AHI, with 15% contibution from the near-infrared 0.85 µm band (B04) and the remaining 85% from the native
    green 0.51 µm band (B02)::

class NDVIHybridGreen(SpectralBlender):

    This green band correction follows the same approach as the HybridGreen compositor, but with a dynamic blend
    factor `f` that depends on the pixel-level Normalized Differece Vegetation Index (NDVI). The higher the NDVI, the
    smaller the contribution from the nir channel will be, following a liner relationship between the two ranges
    `[ndvi_min, ndvi_max]` and `limits`.

    As an example, a new green channel using e.g. FCI data and the NDVIHybridGreen compositor can be defined like::

      ndvi_hybrid_green:
        compositor: !!python/name:satpy.composites.spectral.NDVIHybridGreen

          - name: vis_08
            modifiers: [sunz_corrected ]
        standard_name: toa_bidirectional_reflectance

    In this example, pixels with NDVI=0.0 will be a weighted average with 15% contribution from the
    near-infrared vis_08 channel and the remaining 85% from the native green vis_05 channel, whereas
    pixels with NDVI=1.0 will be a weighted average with 5% contribution from the near-infrared
    vis_08 channel and the remaining 95% from the native green vis_05 channel. For other values of
    NDVI a linear interpolation between these values will be performed.

    This green band correction follows the same approach as the HybridGreen compositor, but with a dynamic blend
    factor `f` that depends on the pixel-level vegetation (NDVI) and soil parameters (NDRI). In addition, three
    sensor-specific constants (ndri_term, ndvi_term and offset_term) are used that define the difference between the
    sensor spectral response and an idealised spectral response suited for vegetation.
    NDVI is calculated via: `(NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED)`
    NDRI is calculated via: `(RED - GRN) / (RED + GRN)`

    (or `ndri` equivalent) arguments. Values outside the min / max values will be clipped.

    Lastly, the `limits` argument allows specification of minimum and maximum values for the `f` term. As with the
    indices, values outside the min / max range will be clipped.
